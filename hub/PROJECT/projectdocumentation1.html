    <h1>3D printing Documentation</h1>

    <p>As part of the project requirements, we are required to 3D print a part for our project.</p>

    <p>Whilst I initially planned for 3D printing the entire water tank for my watering plant system, due to economical reasons and time, it is not feasible to 3D print the entire water tank.</p>

    <p>I instead decided to 3D print a cover for my water sensor that I will be placing in my pot with my plant.</p>

    <p>As can be seen, there some electronic components on the sensor. From previous use of an identical sensor, soaking it entirely in water led to some smoke.</p>

    <p>As a result, I would prefer for water to not be in contact with the electrical components. Hence the 3D printing of a cover for the top part of the sensor.</p>

    <p>After this, I then exported it as a .stl file.</p>

    <p>Opening it with cura, I proceeded to set the settings required such as quality and infill density.</p>
