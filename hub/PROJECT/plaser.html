    <h1>Laser Cutting</h1>
    
    <p>For my project, I will be laser cutting the enclosure that doubles as a water tank.</p>

    <h2>Fusion 360</h2>

    <p>Before laser cutting, I first need to sketch and model the enclosure in Fusion 360 before converting it to the files required for the laser cutter.</p>


    <p>I was able to get a small sheet of clear acrylic from the T11C, unfortunately it was too small to cut the entirety of my panels but I was able to most crucially cut the top piece from it as well as other pieces, this will allow a nice look into the interior of the enclosure.</p>

    <p>Here are the laser cut pieces:</p>

    <p>I finally assembled it </p>
