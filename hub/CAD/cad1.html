    <h2>What is CAD?</h2>

    <p>CAD stands for Computer Aided Design, like the name suggests, CAD is the use of computers to help with the designing process, increasing the productivity of its user.</p>

    <p>Modelling an egg cup is a good illustration of the usefulness of CAD software.</p>

    <p>For instance, if I want to model an egg cup, there are two tools, revolve and shell that would greatly reduce my workload.</p>

    <p>First, I sketch half of the cross section of the egg cup. I sketch half the cross section since I would like it to revolve along the </p>

    <p>I use the revolve command here to do a 360 degree revolve along the Z axis, creating a solid object.</p>

    <p>I then proceed to use the shell tool on top surface of the solid egg cup, this results in a shell with the thickness here being set to 5mm.</p>

    <p>And just like that, I have a modelled egg cup in no time.</p>

    <p>Here is an interactive 3D figure of the model I just made:</p>

    <p>This also illustrates the flexibility of CAD software, there are almost always multiple ways to approach any problem.</p>
