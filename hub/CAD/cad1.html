    <p>CAD stands for Computer Aided Design, like the name suggests, CAD is the use of computers to help with the designing process, increasing the productivity of its user.</p>

    <p>The simple revolve tool is a good illustration of the usefulness of CAD software.</p>

    <p>For instance, if I want to model an egg cup, there are 2 simple ways to modelling it.</p>

    

    <p>This also illustrates the flexibility of CAD software, there are almost always multiple ways to approach any problem.</p>

    <h2>Software that I'm using</h2>
