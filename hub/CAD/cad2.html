    <h1>Computer Aided Design (CAD) Part 2</h1>

    <p>In this second part of CAD, I will be showcasing the uses and benefits of parametric design as well as the steps behind the creation of my 3D model to finding out the limits of 3D printing without supports.</p>

    <h2>What is Parametric Design?</h2>

    <p>Imagine this, you sketch and model a complex 3D model. However upon completion of your work, instead of elation and joy, you feel a sudden pang of despair.</p>
    
    <p>You've made a critical mistake.</p>
 
    <p>You used the wrong scale for your model.</p>

    <p>However, with parametric design, this issue can be easily resolved. </p>

    <p>With parametric design, the values for various measurements can be easily changed.</p>

    <p>Here is an example of the parametric design window in Fusion 360.</p>

    <p>As can be seen here, I have already added 2 user parameters, 'Length' and 'Width'. </p>

    <p>To illustrate this, I will start on creating my 3D model to find the limits of 3D printing, in this case finding the limits of the distance that can be 3D printed without support.</p>

    <p>I will start with a rectangle for the base of my model, assigning the parameters 'Length' and 'Width' to the length and width of my base plate rectangle respectively.</p>

    <img src='../images/documentation/Parametric Design/parametric design width.png'>

    <p>In this case, I have assigned placeholders of 100mm and 50mm respectively for the values of the length and my width of the baseplate.</p>

    <p>If I'm unhappy or change my mind on their dimensions, I can simply edit their values in the parameter window.</p>

    <p>Next, I would like to start modelling the vertical posts from which the filament hang.</p>

    <p>In this case, I've decided on making the length and width of the vertical posts 10mm.</p>
