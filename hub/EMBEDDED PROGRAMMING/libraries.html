    <h2>What are libraries?</h2>

    <p></p>

    <h2>Including libraries with the Arduino IDE</h2>

    <p>First, find the library that you would like to include.</p>

    <p>In this case I would like to down a DHT library for my DHT11 sensor.</p>

    <p>Find a github repository or any download for a .zip file</p>

    <p>In this case, since this is a github repository I just download the entire repository as a .zip file as shown below.</p>

    <p>There is no need to extract the .zip file after download.</p>

    <p>Simply open the Arduino IDE and navigate as shown in the image below:</p>

    <img src="../images/documentation/Embedded Programming/ziplibrary.png" width=50%>

    <p>After clicking on 'Add .zip library', simply select the .zip library through the file explorer.</p>

    <p>After that is done, the added library should show up as shown below:</p>

    <p>Now that the library has been included, simply include the relevant header files at the start of the program to be able to call upon their functions.</p>

    <p>For instance, if I want to include the DHT library to read temperature and humidity from my DHT11 sensor I simply use the following:</p>

<figure>
    <pre><code>
         #include &lt;Adafruit_Sensor.h&gt;
        #include &lt;DHT.h&gt;
        #include &lt;DHT_U.h&gt;
      </code></pre>
</figure>
