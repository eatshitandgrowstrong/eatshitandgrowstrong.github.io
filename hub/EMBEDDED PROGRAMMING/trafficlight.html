    <h1>Traffic Light example</h1>
    
    <p>This is an example of a traffic light for motorists using the arduino and some LEDs.</p>

    <p>Below is the source code:</p>

    <p>I first start by configuring my input and output pins, in this case, using the integrated INPUT_PULLUP resistor for my input.</p>

    <p>By default, the traffic light for motorists is green, with the other yellow and red LEDs at the LOW status.</p>

    <p>When the push button is pressed by a pedestrian, due to the switch being default 'pulled HIGH' by the INPUT_PULLUP resistor, the push button is at an active LOW state when it is pushed.</p>

    <p>The push button therefore sends a LOW signal to the input.</p>
    
    <p>When the input LOW is received, the microcontroller delays and waits for 5 seconds before turning on the yellow LED to indicate to motorists to slow down and switches off the green LED.</p>

    <p>After another 4 seconds, the yellow LED is turned off and the red LED is turned on for 10 seconds.</p>

    <p>With the help of a 'for loop' I am able to have a 'flasher' LED flash on and off for half a second after 5 seconds to indicate to pedestrians that the traffic is turning green soon.</p>
