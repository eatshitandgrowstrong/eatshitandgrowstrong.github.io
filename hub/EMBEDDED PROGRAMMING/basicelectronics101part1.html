    <h1>Basic Electronics Guide</h1>

    <p>In this first part on basic electronics, I will be covering some basic electronic components as well as a couple formulas used in DC circuits.</p>

    <h2>Several basic electronic components</h2>

    <h3>Resistor</h3>

    <p>One of the most basic electronic components, resistors literally resist current, in microcontroller circuits they can be used to control voltages and currents.</p>

    <p>Here is an image of a 1 kiloohm resistor as well as its electronic symbol.</p>

    <h3>Resistor Colour Coding</h3>

    <p>As can be seen from the image above, you might have noticed several coloured bands around the resistor.</p>

    <p>These are the resistor's colour coding. Here is a colour coding chart:</p>

    <p>Resistors can have multiple colour bands, 4, 5 or even 6 colour bands to code information about the resistor.</p>

    <p>For simplicity's sake I have included a 4 colour band resistor and colour code.</p>

    <p>Before we get into how to read it, we must first understand the </p>

    <p>Well how do you read it?</p>
