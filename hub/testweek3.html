    <h1>Week 3</h1>

    <p>For week 3 we learned about hosting via github and the steps, for example commiting and pushing.</p>

    <p>We also learnt about other alternatives like markdown</p>

    <p>I started to organise my page, trying new stuff such as hyperlinking to a page dedicated for that week instead of dumping everything on the original index.html</p>
